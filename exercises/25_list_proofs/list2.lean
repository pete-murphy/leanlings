/- # List Proofs 2: Map and Reverse

  More list properties:
  - `List.length_map` : (l.map f).length = l.length
  - `List.map_id` : l.map id = l
  - `List.length_reverse` : l.reverse.length = l.length

  `simp` knows these too, but you can also prove them
  by induction for extra practice.

  TODO: Prove these by simp or induction.
