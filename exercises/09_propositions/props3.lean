/- # Propositions 3: Negation and Implication

  • `A → B` (implication): a function from proof of A to proof of B.
    Proved by `fun (h : A) => ...proof of B...`

  • `¬A` (negation): defined as `A → False`.
    To prove ¬A, assume A and derive a contradiction.

  • `absurd : α → ¬α → β` derives anything from a contradiction.

  These proofs are written as function expressions (term-mode).
  In the next module, you'll learn tactic mode — an alternative
  way to build proofs step by step.

  TODO: Provide proofs for each theorem using `fun`.

-- If we know P and P → Q, we can prove Q

-- From a contradiction (P and ¬P), we can prove anything
