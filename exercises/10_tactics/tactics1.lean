/- # Tactics 1: intro and exact

  In the previous module, you wrote proofs as expressions
  (e.g., `fun h => h`). Tactic mode is an alternative:
  instead of building the proof term yourself, you give
  step-by-step instructions and Lean builds it for you.

  Enter tactic mode with `by`:

    theorem foo : P → P := by
      intro h    -- introduces hypothesis `h : P`
      exact h    -- closes the goal with `h`

  • `intro h` moves the hypothesis from the goal into context
  • `exact term` closes the goal when `term` has the right type

  TODO: Complete the proofs using `intro` and `exact`.

-- Introduce the hypothesis, then provide it as the proof
theorem self_implication (P : Prop) : P → P := by
  intro p
  exact p

-- Introduce both hypotheses, then use the right one
theorem use_second (P Q : Prop) : P → Q → Q := by
  intro l r
  exact r

-- Function composition
theorem compose (P Q R : Prop) : (P → Q) → (Q → R) → P → R := by
  intro f g a
  exact g (f a)
