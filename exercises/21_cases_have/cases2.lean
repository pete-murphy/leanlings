/- # Cases and Have 3: Cases on Data Types

  `cases` works on any inductive type, not just propositions:

    cases n with
    | zero => ...
    | succ m => ...  -- m is the predecessor

  For Bool:
    cases b with
    | true => ...
    | false => ...

  This is tactic-mode pattern matching.

  Tip: `<;>` applies a tactic to ALL resulting subgoals at once:
    cases b <;> rfl    -- tries `rfl` in every branch

  TODO: Prove these using `cases`.

-- A number is either zero or positive
theorem zero_or_pos (n : Nat) : n = 0 ∨ n > 0 := by
  cases n with
  | zero => omega
  | succ m => omega

-- Boolean and is commutative
theorem bool_and_comm (a b : Bool) : (a && b) = (b && a) := by
  cases (a, b) <;> decide +revert -- TODO: arrived at this by guessing
